### **1. Informed Consent Form (Template)**

**Project Title:** Usability Study for an AI-Powered Content Censorship Tool

**Researchers:** [Your Name(s)]

**Introduction & Purpose of Study:**
You are invited to participate in a research study for our capstone project. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of a new software prototype called "AI Auto Censorer," which is designed to automatically detect and censor inappropriate content in videos for parents and television studios. Your feedback will be invaluable in helping us improve its design and functionality.

**Procedures:**
If you agree to participate, you will join a remote, moderated session lasting approximately 45 minutes. During this session, you will be asked to:
1.  Share your screen with the moderator.
2.  Interact with the software prototype to perform a series of tasks. These tasks will involve uploading video clips and using the software's features to censor them.
3.  "Think aloud" as you perform the tasks, sharing your thoughts and impressions.
4.  Complete a short survey (the System Usability Scale) and answer a few follow-up questions about your experience.

**!! Content Warning !!**
Please be aware that the primary function of this tool is to censor inappropriate content. To test its effectiveness, you will be asked to work with short, uncensored video clips that contain **profane language and simulated/cartoon violence**. The content has been selected for testing purposes and is not intended to be gratuitously offensive, but your participation requires exposure to this content. You may stop the test at any time if you feel uncomfortable.

**Risks and Discomforts:**
The primary risk is potential discomfort from exposure to the inappropriate language and visuals in the test video clips. You have the right to withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, without penalty.

**Confidentiality:**
Your participation will be kept confidential. We will record the screen and your voice during the session for analysis purposes only. Your name will be replaced with a participant ID (e.g., "Participant 1"). Any personal information will be removed, and the raw recordings will be accessible only to the research team.

**Voluntary Participation:**
Your participation in this study is completely voluntary. You may refuse to participate or withdraw at any time.

**Contact Information:**
If you have any questions about the study, please contact [Your Name] at [Your Email Address].

### **2. Privacy and Data Protection Plan**

1.  **Data Collection:**
    * We will collect the following data during user testing sessions:
        * Screen recordings of the participant interacting with the software.
        * Audio recordings of the participant's "think-aloud" commentary.
        * Responses to the System Usability Scale (SUS) survey.
        * Notes taken by the moderator during the session.
    * No personal cameras (webcams) will be used or recorded to protect participant identity.

2.  **Data Anonymization:**
    * Each participant will be assigned a non-identifying ID (e.g., P1, P2, P3). All collected files and notes will be labeled using this ID instead of the participant's name.
    * Participants will be instructed not to share any personally identifiable information (PII) during the session. If any PII is accidentally mentioned in a recording, it will be edited out or redacted from the transcript.

3.  **Data Storage and Security:**
    * All raw data (recordings, survey results) will be stored on a password-protected and encrypted hard drive or a secure, university-approved cloud storage service (e.g., Google Drive with restricted access).
    * Access to the raw data will be strictly limited to the members of the capstone project team.

4.  **Data Usage:**
    * The collected data will be used solely for the purpose of analyzing the usability of the AI Auto Censorer prototype.
    * Anonymized quotes and aggregated survey data may be used in the final capstone project report and presentation. No data will be used that could identify a specific participant.

5.  **Data Retention and Deletion:**
    * All raw data, including video and audio recordings, will be securely deleted within 30 days of the final project submission and grading.
    * Anonymized, aggregated data (e.g., overall SUS scores, summary of findings) will be retained as part of the project's academic record.
