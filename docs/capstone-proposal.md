# Capstone Proposal – ThinkBit

## 1. Problem Statement
Explain the real-world issue, who experiences it, why existing solutions fail, and why AI is appropriate.

## 2. Target Users
Describe user demographics, context, needs, and pain points.

## 3. Success Criteria
| Metric | Target | Type |
|---------|---------|------|
| User satisfaction | ≥ 80 % “helpful” ratings | Product |
| Avg. response time | ≤ 3 s | Technical |
| Model cost/query | ≤ $0.10 | Technical |
| Weekly commits/team member | ≥ 3 | Process |
| Evaluation accuracy | ≥ 75 % | AI |

## 4. Technical Architecture
Describe the system and include a diagram (`docs/architecture.png`).
Example stack:


## 5. Risk Assessment
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| API cost spikes | Medium | High | Cache results, fallback model |
| Inconsistent model outputs | Medium | Medium | Prompt templates, eval tests |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

## 6. Research Plan
Summarize what you’ll study (papers, APIs, model evaluation methods) and when.

## 7. User Study Plan
Describe how you’ll recruit users, what you’ll test, privacy protection, and consent.

## 8. Project Timeline
| Week | Milestone |
|------|------------|
| 3–4 | Setup + “Hello World” prototype |
| 5–6 | MVP + first AI integration |
| 7–10 | User testing, iteration |
| 11–13 | Evaluation + polish |
| 14–15 | Demo + final report |
